As a mark of remembrance of Mmiri Ohia Owerre-Nkworji, the UmuEke/Owerre-Nkworji-born and Dutch trained Microcomputer Scientist ~ Engr. Ezekwesiri Enyinnaya Obioha (Eke UmuEke) in collaboration with the Dutch Non-Governmental Organisation, Igbo Restoration has partnered with the land and people of Owerre-Nkworji via the traditional leader; HRH. Eze Boniface Unogu (Ishigbo I) of Owerre-Nkworji to restore the beauty, elegance, usefulness and glories of Ohia Stream in Owerre-Nkworji.

Via this Ceremony the traditional leader of Owerre-Nkworji HRH. Eze Boniface Unogu (Ishigbo I) who is the custodian of Culture and Traditions in Owerre-Nkworji has authorised Igbo Restoration Holland to unconditionally restore Ohia stream back to the paradise she once was.

Soon (2024), Igbo Restoration shall commence the feasibility study of the project to determine the best natural ways to restore Ohia and preserve her nature.

Thanks for your time.
