From ArtKids Foundation to Igbo Restoration Initiatives (IRI)

Since after the announcement of my resignation as the MD of ArtKids Africa, I have received phone calls and messages from concerned indigenes of the communities where   development projects were declared either by ArtKids Foundation or by Igbo Restoration Initiatives (IRI)

Few of such ongoing Projects include:

* Ohia Stream Restoration Project at Owerre-Nkworji in Imo State
* DiscoverMe Musical Event at Etche Road Stadium Aba (Enyimba City) on the 2nd of June 2024.
* African Idol  December 2024 at Abuja
* ComputerABCD (Technology sensitisation and digitisation project)~Abia, Imo, Enugu, Ebony and Anambra States 2025.

Let me once again assure the indigenes of the above mentioned communities and states that my resignation as the MD of ArtKids Africa wouldn't in any way affect any of these projects negatively.

As a stakeholder with Artkids Foundation Holland and a Project consultant with Igbo Restoration Initiatives (IRI), I am fully in charge of the smooth implementation of ongoing projects.

While thanking the indigenes and leaders of partnered communities and states, I reiterate my unwavering commitment and assurances that I will personally oversee the smooth implementation of the above-mentioned projects.

Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.

Engr. Ezekwesiri Enyinnaya Obioha (ICT)

Project Coordinator: Igbo Restoration Initiatives (IRI)
