Born as a Mixed Race Child with a Black Mother and White Father in the Country of Holland, my Spirit never felt at Home in the West. I was Born there, but Never Really Belonges there. As the Black blood inside my System kept Calling me to "Return Home".

The Spirit world Reserved me As a Small Child for a Calling of Healing and Unification. So my ways never befitted the Cold and self-centered ways of the Money and Material centered Dutch, I nevertheless followed there studies and working systems.

So i found myself working for Charity and Non-Governmental projects for 22 years. Applying my ICT Expertise to Support cultural works & knowledge development amongst Children, Youth and Adult People of Holland.

Under the Same Direction of the Spirits I was fortunate to be Invited and Welcomed Highly to Practice my Profession and Share my Knowledge and Experience in Igboland.
