## Allow us to Introduce ourselves? get to know us

Igbo Restoration Initiatives (IRI) is founded by a team of seven highly committed individuals who have the development and enlightenment of Igboland in Mind. We are the board members of Igbo Restoration. We would therefore like to introduce ourselves, so you may know who you are [supporting](/en/donations/), with whom you are doing [business](/en/contact-us), or who you are [working for](/en/job-offerings/), if you visit our showroom, buying gifts from our shop, or from our door-2-door salesmen or one of the many other forms Igbo Restoration uses to raise funds.

Besides the core team, Igbo Restoration works with the locals in our respective project locations-- especially in Igboland.
